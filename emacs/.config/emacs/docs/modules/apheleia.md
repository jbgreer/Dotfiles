# Prelude Apheleia

## Overview

[Apheleia](https://github.com/radian-software/apheleia) is a
unified format-on-save framework for Emacs. On save, it runs the
appropriate external formatter (Prettier, Black, Ruff, gofmt,
rustfmt, ...) asynchronously, then patches the buffer with the
result. The patching is point-preserving and flicker-free -- it
feels like the formatter ran instantly with no visible buffer
churn.

Apheleia ships with sensible defaults for dozens of formatters and
many major modes out of the box. Look at `apheleia-formatters` and
`apheleia-mode-alist` for the full list.

## What this module does

Just two things:

1. Installs the `apheleia` package.
2. Enables `apheleia-global-mode`.

That's it -- no further setup required for the languages Apheleia
already knows about.

## Relationship to language modules

Several Prelude language modules install their own format-on-save
hooks (e.g. `rust-format-on-save` in `prelude-rust`,
`gofmt-before-save` in `prelude-go`). These keep working with
Apheleia enabled -- they just run redundantly. If you enable this
module you can safely drop them from your personal config, or
disable them with hooks like:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'rust-ts-mode
  (setq rust-format-on-save nil))

(with-eval-after-load 'go-mode
  (remove-hook 'before-save-hook 'gofmt-before-save))
```

## Adding a formatter

For languages or tools Apheleia doesn't know about, register a
formatter and tell Apheleia which mode it applies to:

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'apheleia
  (setf (alist-get 'shfmt apheleia-formatters)
        '("shfmt" "-i" "2" "-ci"))
  (setf (alist-get 'sh-mode apheleia-mode-alist) 'shfmt))
```

See the [Apheleia README](https://github.com/radian-software/apheleia)
for the formatter spec and built-in entries you can copy from.

## Disabling per buffer

If you need to skip formatting for a specific buffer, run
`M-x apheleia-mode` to toggle it off locally. To skip a whole
project, set a directory-local `apheleia-inhibit` to `t`.
